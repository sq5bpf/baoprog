baoprog - Baofeng UV3R EEPROM programmer v0.2
(c) 2012 Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@lipkowski.org>

This program can read and write the eeprom of Baofeng UV3R Mark II and probably
other similar radios via the serial port.  It can read/write arbitrary data,
and might be useful for reverse engineering the radio configuration. Please
note that it is probably possible to break yor radio by writing a bad
configuration to it, so please use at your own risk. The program is written to
(hopefully) run on POSIX systems. Testing was done on GNU/Linux, but MacOS X
and windows under cygwin should work too. For licensing see the file LICENSE.

The communications protocol information was taken from the Chirp sources.


---- Usage ----

For a basic usage use -r to read eeprom, -w to write eeprom. The -v option
gives more verbosity.

Read configuration:

sq5bpf@dellix:~/baoprog-0.1$ ./baoprog -v -r
Baofeng UV3R EEPROM programmer v0.1 (c) 2012 Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@lipkowski.org>

uv3r_prepare: try 0
Sucessfuly read eeprom

The eeprom contents are written to the file uv3r_eeprom.raw, this can be
changed with the -f option.


Write configuration from file uv3r_eeprom.raw:

sq5bpf@dellix:~/baoprog-0.1$ ./baoprog -v -w
Baofeng UV3R EEPROM programmer v0.1 (c) 2012 Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@lipkowski.org>

uv3r_prepare: try 0
Read file uv3r_eeprom.raw success
Sucessfuly wrote eeprom


Other configuration options are:
-f <file>       filename that contains the eeprom dump (default: uv3r_eeprom.raw)
-r      read eeprom
-w      write eeprom
-p <port>       device name (default: /dev/ttyUSB0)
-s <speed>      serial speed (default: 9600, the UV3R doesn't accept any other speed)
-h      print this help
-v      be verbose, use multiple times for more verbosity



The baopatch utility is for setting various configuration settings bits in the 
UV-3R Mark II eeprom image. This has been abandoned for now, but works
somewhat. No documentation is given, use baopatch -h or read the source. 


---- Compiling ----

This software was tested to compile using gcc on GNU/Linux systems, using a
simple makefile:

sq5bpf@dellix:~/baoprog-0.1$ make
gcc -O2 baoprog.c -o baoprog

Other POSIX platforms should work also, including MacOS X. 

The software compiles under Cygwin/Microsoft Windows, but has not been tested.
According to the cygwin documentation you should use /dev/comX to use port comX
(for example using com6: baoprog.exe -v -r -p /dev/com6)


If port this to another platform, or do anything interesting with this
software, tell me about it.

---- Other uses ----

The file uv3r_markII_eeprom.raw contains an eeprom downloaded from a UV-3R Mark
II with 65-108MHz radio. Maybe it can be used to resurrect another radio of the
same type, which was flashed with an incorrect firmware version (the DDD.D25
problem), or maybe it will enable 65-108MHz FM radio. If you want to risk it,
it can be flashed to your radio like this:

baoprog -f uv3r_markII_eeprom.raw -v -w -p /dev/port

where /dev/port would be the serial port device (on linux for example
/dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyS1 etc, on windows /dev/com1 etc).
